4. Software Defect Reporting
If you find software defects in the KLS, you agree to make reasonable efforts to report them to Kiloview in accordance with the KLS documentation or in such other manner as Kiloview directs in writing. Kiloview will evaluate and, at its sole discretion, may address them in a future revision of the KLS. Kiloview does not warrant the KLS to be free of defects.

5. Updates
You understand and agree that Kiloview may amend, modify, change, and/or cease distribution or production of the KLS at any time. You understand that you are not entitled to receive any upgrades, updates, or future versions of the KLS under this License. Kiloview does not warrant or represent that its future updates and revisions will be compatible with existing versions.

6. Ownership
Nothing herein is intended to convey to you any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other Intellectual Property owned by Kiloview or its Licensors in the KLS or in any Kiloview software, hardware, products, trade names, or trademarks. Kiloview and its suppliers or licensors shall retain all right, title, and interest in the foregoing Intellectual Property and to the KLS.

7. Indemnity and Limitations
You agree to indemnify and hold Kiloview harmless from any third party claim, loss, or damage (including attorney's fees) related to your use, sale or distribution of the KLS. The KLS is provided to you free of charge, and on an "AS IS" basis and "WITH ALL FAULTS", without any technical support or warranty of any kind from Kiloview. You assume all risks that the KLS is suitable or accurate for your needs and your use of the KLS is at your own discretion and risk.

8. Limitation of Damages
Neither Kiloview nor its suppliers or licensors shall be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages or loss (including damages for loss of business, loss of profits, or the like), arising out of this License whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, product liability or otherwise, even if Kiloview or its representatives have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. The limited warranty, exclusive remedies and limited liability set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Kiloview and you. You agree that Kiloview would not be able to provide the Software on an economic basis without such limitations. In no event will Kiloview be liable for any amount greater than what you actually paid for the KLS.

9. Termination
Either party may terminate this License upon thirty (30) days written notice. Either party may also terminate if the other party materially defaults in the performance of any provision of this License, the non-defaulting party gives written notice to the other party of such default, and the defaulting party fails to cure such default within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice. Upon the termination of this License, the rights and licenses granted to you by Kiloview pursuant to this License will automatically cease. Nothing herein shall prevent either party from pursuing any injunctive relief at any time if necessary, or seeking any other remedies available in equity. Each party reserves the right to pursue all legal and equitable remedies available. Upon termination, all KLS materials shall be promptly returned to Kiloview, and any and all copies stored in electronic or other format shall be deleted and destroyed, and any rights to use Kiloview’s trademarks are revoked. If this License is terminated for any reason, the provisions of Sections 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 shall survive such termination.

10. General
